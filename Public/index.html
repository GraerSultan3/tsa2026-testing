            <p>I was lowkirkenuinely imagining that we'd had a "Who are we" type pargraph here => I'd like to suggest it go here. I feel like if we don't have anything up here, it'll be a really weird jump from the navbar to the programs/quotes + timeline events.</p>

                    <h2>Habitat For Humanity</h2>
                    <p>Bryan is host to a local chapter of the global non-proft housing organization, Habitat for Humanity. Bryan Habitat for Humanity is dedicated to constructing reliable housing for families and especially those apart of the Bryan Independent School Distircit. The support provided to students beyond the class room was recently exemplified by the building of a home for the Quintero-Mendez family in 2023. WIth 3 generations of Bryan residents, the community came together to provide for their own. </p>
                    <p>“Most importantly, Habitat for Humanity was founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a simple, durable place to live in dignity and safety, and that decent shelter in decent communities should be a matter of conscience and action for all.”</p>
